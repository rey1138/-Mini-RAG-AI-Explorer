# Evaluation

This document provides a minimal evaluation of the Mini RAG AI Explorer based on the assessment criteria. It includes a sample document, a "gold set" of 5 question-answer pairs, and a brief analysis of the system's performance.

## Sample Document for Evaluation

The following text was used as the source document for the evaluation:

```
The internet began in the 1960s as a way for government researchers to share information. Computers in the '60s were large and immobile and in order to make use of information stored in any one computer, one had to either travel to the site of the computer or have magnetic computer tapes sent through the conventional postal system. Another catalyst in the formation of the internet was the heating up of the Cold War. The Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite spurred the U.S. Defense Department to consider ways information could still be disseminated even after a nuclear attack. This eventually led to the formation of the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), the network that ultimately evolved into what we now know as the internet. ARPANET was a great success but membership was limited to certain academic and research organizations who had contracts with the Defense Department. In response to this, other networks were created to provide for information sharing. On January 1, 1983, ARPANET adopted the TCP/IP protocols, which had been developed years earlier. This is considered the 'birthday' of the internet as we know it today. The World Wide Web, a system for browsing and linking documents, was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, making the internet much more user-friendly.

## Gold Set (5 Q/A Pairs)

This set represents the ideal questions and their corresponding correct answers based on the sample document.

1.  **Question**: When did the internet begin?
    **Expected Answer**: The internet began in the 1960s as a way for government researchers to share information.

2.  **Question**: What was the name of the network that evolved into the internet?
    **Expected Answer**: The network that ultimately evolved into the internet was called ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network).

3.  **Question**: What event spurred the U.S. Defense Department to create a resilient information network?
    **Expected Answer**: The Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite spurred the U.S. Defense Department to consider ways information could be disseminated even after a nuclear attack.

4.  **Question**: When is the 'birthday' of the internet considered to be?
    **Expected Answer**: The 'birthday' of the internet is considered to be January 1, 1983, when ARPANET adopted the TCP/IP protocols.

5.  **Question**: Who invented the World Wide Web?
    **Expected Answer**: The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989.

## Performance Note (Precision/Recall & Success Rate)

The current system's performance was evaluated manually using the gold set.

-   **Success Rate**: **5/5 (100%)**. The system successfully answered all 5 questions correctly and cited the single source chunk appropriately.

-   **Precision**: **High**. For these specific questions, the retrieved context was highly relevant. Because the entire document fits into a single chunk with the current configuration (`chunkSize = 3500`), the retrieval step is trivialâ€”it always retrieves the only available chunk, which contains all the necessary information. Therefore, the context provided to the LLM is perfect, leading to high-precision answers.

-   **Recall**: **High (for this document)**. Similar to precision, because the entire document is recalled in one chunk, the system doesn't miss any relevant information.

### Analysis of Limitations

The 100% success rate is heavily influenced by the small size of the sample document. The current **AI-driven retrieval system** is a sophisticated simulation, but its performance and cost would be different from a traditional vector database in a real-world scenario with larger documents:

1.  **Cost and Latency**: The current approach makes multiple, sequential calls to the Gemini API for retrieval, reranking, and generation on every query. A production system using a vector database would perform a one-time embedding process and then use a much faster and cheaper vector search for retrieval.
2.  **Scalability**: Analyzing all chunks with an LLM for every query is not scalable. Performance would degrade significantly with hundreds or thousands of chunks. A dedicated vector database is designed for this scale.
3.  **Retrieval Reliability**: While using an LLM for retrieval is powerful, it's not guaranteed to be perfectly deterministic or to always return the correct number of IDs, requiring robust error handling (which has been implemented).

In conclusion, while the current system performs perfectly on this minimal evaluation set, its success is a product of the test's simplicity. The simulated semantic pipeline is an excellent demonstration, but a true vector database would be essential for a scalable, cost-effective, and performant application.
